# Adventure Archive

Platform where users can share archaeological sites and amazing places. Its sorta like Reddit because its a discussion platform for sharing/talking about archaeological sites and sorta like Instagram because users scroll can through sites and leave comments much like Instagram.

3. Delete archaeological sites.
4. View comments on archaeological sites.
5. Login with a username.
6. Leave comments on archaeological sites.
7. Explore Beautiful places around the world with the explore button.

# Roadmap

1. Add Google Maps to automatically locate the archaeological site based on its name and show it on a map.
2. Give the option to add images to archaeological sites as image URLs and display them as a carusel.

# Known Bugs/Quick Improvements
1. Comments disappear after editing sites.
2. Button shenanigans after you login, then logout, then login again.
3. Move `delete` button up to align with `done` button.
4. Add `esc` button to top right of the add site form.
5. Background images don't load properly on mobile. Could solve with a media screen query.
